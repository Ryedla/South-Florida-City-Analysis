# Problem and the background

South Florida (colloquially and locally known as SoFlo) is a geographic and cultural region that generally comprises Florida's southernmost counties, and is the fourth most populous (6.69 million) urban agglomeration in the United States. It is one of Florida's three most common "directional" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida. It includes the populous Miami metropolitan area, the Everglades, the Florida Keys, and other localities. South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate.

My friend runs a business in Boca Raton, South Florida, and the revenue genration happens from the venues like restaurants, coffee shops, pubs, and other B2C businesses. In order to optimise his sales people efforts, he must have data backed answers 
for the below:

  1. What venues should be prioritized for reaching out to them for business
  2. To grow business and expand geographically, what geographies should be considered beyond Boca Raton

The idea behind this project is to find out the above and the target audience is anyone who want to have the information about the popular venues in Boca and to find out other cities in South Florida that are like Boca. I have used the Four Square API, and Web Parsing techniques to get the data and find the most popular venues in Boca Raton and this will solve the problem of prioritizing the businesses to reach out to. For the second problem, the algorithm to be used is k-means clustering so I can find out the cities that share common characteristics with Boca.
